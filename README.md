```jsx
var a;
a = 7;
var b;
b = a;

// Only change code below this line
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";
// Only change code above this line
a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
var sum = 10 + 0; //this can be var product,sum, difference, quotient
var myVar = 87;
myVar++; //this equals 88 now - same goes with i-- 

var ourDecimal = 5.7;  //decimals are floating points
var product = 2.0 * 2.5; //this can be var product,sum, difference, quotient

var remainder = 11 % 3;
console.log("The remainder is " + remainder);
//Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator. It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

var a = 3;
// Only change code below this line
a += 12; //a = 15 now
a -= 12
a *= 12
a /= 12

var myFirstName = 'Dimitri';
var myLastName  = 'Brooks';

var myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\".";

var myStr = '<a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link</a>'; 
//Notice that this has single quotes at the beginning and does not need escape characters for the quotes in the middle
