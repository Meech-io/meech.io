### PROJECT SUMMARY

A brief summary will help the future team understand the main topics and goals concerning the project, as well as useful background information.
Example items in this section may be: **basic explanation of fundamental concepts**, **problems** you may have encountered and **suggested solutions.**

**Be clear and short** in what you write, and remember to outline the particular objectives of the project, including all relevant details.

Keep in mind: **introduction makes the first impression!**

### CLIENT INTRODUCTION

While you're working for a project, you may have to deal with stakeholders and clients. 
A short introduction of such subjects can be provided down below,  to serve as a reminder for the future team, so they will know who they are going to deal with, and what their dreams, aspirations and conduct.
In the **Client Page** you can add more infos, such as **contacts and tips for the future team.**

*Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam eaque ipsa, quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt, explicabo.*

Below you can see the Handover Tasks, listing all activities that will take place during the handover process.
You have many ways of visualising these dates, but don't worry, it really is simpler than it looks! 

Protip! If you sort your objectives by status, you'll see what's been done, what is progressing and what's missing. 
If you prefer the calendar view, you can see the dates of all events and what's coming up next.

Use the template below to build a schedule for the handover process.

Protip! View them as a kanban or as a calendar!

### WHAT'S LEFT?

The teams that came before you have left the foundations for starting your work.
They have also left the next steps to your journey, so your challenge for the start of this experience will be to carry on these challenges.
